# PACMEN FACTORY
Factory for making pacmen.

## How to run.
I recommend using VS Code and opening all files in the folder. From HTML file open with the Live Server extension. 
This should open the "game" in the browser. 

### Buttons
You could go about running the "game" in a couple of different ways. You could begin by clicking "start" and then click "add pacman". This would result in pacman moving straight away. You are free to add as many pacmen as you wish. The function will alternate between an img of pacman with his mouth open and one with his mouth closed. 

Another way to run the "game" would be to click the "add pacman" button until you have generated the amount of pacmen that you desire, and then click "start" to initiate movement. 

Simply click "reset" to start over and clear the screen. 

### RoadMap

I am currently working on marrying an earlier exercise that made pacman appear to be chomping as he moved across the screen. Future versions of this will feature that animation. 
I will also add audio files/sound effects.
